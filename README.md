# Smart Rain Barrel

The best way for me to participate in Justineâ€™s hobbies is to over-engineer them and her garden is no different. To reduce our water use I came up with a smart water barrel that:

* Can turn the pump for the barrel water on and off
* Has four float switches to detect the barrel water level
* Uses two valves to select barrel water or city water
* Monitors two soil moisture sensors to determine if watering is needed
* Connects to my Home Assistant automation server for control and logging
* Uses the weather forecast to postpone watering if rain is imminent
